# Start project for code lab in week 1
This project is meant for being used in the following way:
- Students group in pairs
- Each pair of students will join another pair of students to form a group of 4 students
- Each team of students will fork this project and work on the tasks.
- Whenever a pair of students has finished a task, they will create a pull request to the repository.
- The other pair of students will review the pull request and approve it (or ask for changes).
- The team of students will then merge the pull request.
- At the end of the day, each team will commit and push a Readme.md file with the names of the students in the team and the tasks they have completed.

## How to use this project
1. In the dk.cphbusiness.flightdemo.FlightReader class, you will find methods to read flight data from a json file into a list of DTO objects.
2. To see an example of using streams to get info from the collection, look at the dk.cphbusiness.flightdemo.FlightReader.getFlightInfoDetails() method.
3. In the test package, you will find a test class that tests the FlightReader class. Build on this to add more functionality to the FlightReader class.
